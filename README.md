# 📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis  
**Descriptive Analytics & KPI Dashboarding**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior data to uncover purchasing patterns, revenue drivers, and customer segmentation insights within an e-commerce environment.

The focus of this project is **descriptive analytics** — understanding what is happening in the business using structured SQL queries and dashboard visualization.

This project demonstrates:

- KPI tracking and business reporting  
- Revenue and category performance analysis  
- Customer segmentation (age, gender, subscription status)  
- Purchase behavior trends  
- Dashboard design for executive decision support

## 🎯 Business Objectives

This analysis answers the following questions:

1. What is the overall revenue performance and average purchase value?
2. Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
3. How do different age groups contribute to sales?
4. What percentage of customers are subscribed vs non-subscribed?
5. Are there visible behavioral differences across segments?

## 📈 Dashboard Insights

### Revenue Performance
- Average purchase value remains stable across segments.
- Certain product categories contribute disproportionately to total revenue.

### Category Performance
- Clothing generates the highest revenue contribution.
- Accessories and footwear show moderate performance.
- Some lower-performing categories may benefit from pricing or promotional optimization.

### Age Group Analysis
- Customers aged 25–34 contribute the largest share of revenue.
- Younger and older segments show lower purchase contribution.

### Subscription Distribution
- Majority of customers are non-subscribed.
- Subscription-based targeting could increase repeat purchase potential.
